# Project 2: Persist

## Description

Our project is centered around the concept of a day. 
Every person has the same 24 hours but every person spends them differently. 
We wanted to create an app that would be able to reflect the 
uniqueness of the user's day as well as giving them the 
ability to customize their day however they like. 
Let's face it, not everyone works a 9-5 job so there 
needs to be a day scheduler that reflects that. And that is just what Persist does.

Our main motivation for making Persist was to have a fool-proof day planner that is 
so simple, easy to use, and sleek that you are left with no 
excuses not to use it and not have your days 
planned out and organized. You should never miss another appointment or date again. 

We styled the app around having the ability to customize the ENTIRE day so that 
the user did not feel restricted to the "typical" day of the "average joe". 
Not everyone has the same schedule; some people work night shifts, some people 
work part time, some people don't work at all. 
Our app ensures that the user has the ability to customize all 24 hours of their day; 
if they choose to do so, that is.

While doing this project our group learned that using the TIME factor is one of the hardest 
things to work with. 
There are so many facators that go into working with time that would not go 
into other apps that don't have this feature. 
We also learned that, as users ourselves, the ability to have full control over 
customization for an app is key to being able to please every single person who uses the app.

## Usage

Usage for this app is very simple. 
The user is first directed to the homepage where the title of the app is shown 
and the button to log in.

Once the user clicks the login button they are then asked to login 
with their credential by AuthZero, the third party service used for 
user authentication. They can either create 
a new user account, log in if they already have an account, 
or log in with their google acount if they have one.

Once logged in, the user can view their day as a whole by clicking on the
Day View tab where they are presented with the full 24 hours for the current day. Here, 
they can see the tasks they have planned for this day and the blocked 
off time for when the task starts and ends.
Under each task name, the  user is prompted with a question: 
"Did you complete this on time?" this is giving the user the opportunity to say no they did not 
complete the specific task for the amount of hours they 
said they would and gives them an option to edit the amount of 
hours the task actually took them, or yes they did complete the task as they planned earlier.

The user can then fill up their day by clicking on the New Task tab 
in the navigation bar where they can create their new task with a unique name, description, 
specify the amount of hours they wish to do the task for, and the option to give the task
a color.

The user can also view their schedule by categories or tasks by clicking on the 
Categories tab on the navigation bar. 
This allows the user to see each one of their tasks for their day in 
individual cards and see the alloted time for each task.
